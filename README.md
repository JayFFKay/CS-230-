Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

In an effort to reach to more customers, social media company Chat Away wants to develop a mobile platform version of their website, needing the app to be distributable and runnable on both Android and iOS with the budget and timeline being a high priority in the project

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did qwll on the requirements and specs of the different systems of the game. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It allowed me to have a faint outline of the project as well as potential directions it could go, giving me some things that I shouldn't need in it or some things I should add top it.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Probably the first version and detailing more about the requirements and restrictions as it does seem a bit vague to me even now.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

If you don't interpret the user's needs and implement them, you're not making a product for the audience you want to make it for but instead for yourself, failing at creating the product as a whole.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I looked at the different requirements for the different systems the game was going to be on and made sure to make it work on them, or at least a bit compatible with them as I only have a Windows computer.
